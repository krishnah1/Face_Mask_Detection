# Face Mask Detection 😷

**Face mask detection** is a computer vision technology that identifies if a person is wearing a face mask correctly, incorrectly, or not at all in images. It's crucial for enforcing mask mandates, ensuring public safety, and reducing disease transmission. Using deep learning models, it categorizes faces and assigns labels like "With Mask" or "Without Mask," often with associated confidence scores. Face mask detection is widely used in public spaces, healthcare, workplaces, and transportation settings to promote mask compliance and protect public health.

## ⚠️Tech Stack

- **OpenCV**

- **Keras**

- **TensorFlow** 

- **Scikit learn** 

- **Matplotlib** 


## ⭐ Features

- Detects faces in images or real-time video streams.
- Classifies each face as 'With Mask,' 'Without Mask,' or 'Incorrectly Worn Mask.'
- Users can tailor the face mask detection system by adjusting model settings and parameters to achieve optimal performance in various usage scenarios and environmental contexts.
